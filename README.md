 # Introduction
 Hey, im Akira and im writing you a Guide on how to install Yuzu without having a Switch, since i discovered this is literally a pain in the ass.
 I try to make it as easy as possible, but be sure to check this out if you need new Keys, since i try to keep this always up-to-date! <3

 # Guide

  # Setup
 First you will need the [Yuzu-Installer](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/liftinstall/releases/download/1.8/yuzu_install.exe).
 Open it, and let it do its own stuff and be sure to have it like this.
 ![YuzuInstall](https://fuckedyour.doctor/jHMFQqDS.png?key=r2dUCnMvj8qhPR)

 After its done just press Exit and search for yuzu in your Windows Search Bar.
 ![YuzuWeilPrime](https://sexin.church/dVZ1smTb.png?key=56adoSGTXNiWYu)

 Yuzu will open and show this Screen
 ![DuBistDoof](https://nuke.bayern/9RTatw4x.png?key=J7cFCPraHXStHb)
 on there click Emulation -> Configure -> System -> Profile
 Then press on Add and make a new Profile, then close Yuzu

  # Files
 Press Windows + R and type %appdata%\yuzu and the press Enter and Explorer should pop up
 ![ZwZ](https://i.uwu.plus/pxRyGEar.png?key=KXsLcqhbDZuQHc)

 Create a folder called "keys" and copy the key you got from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i17XAjiwKLwml_9mzLQ4GF6RYidaCFcG?usp=sharing) Section and paste it in the Foler.
 Then go back out of the keys Folder and paste the Contents of the Switch Fimware Folder found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SwobY3yIATNeFc-HC3z_iJKhkG-9pLR6?usp=sharing) and click yes if it wants to override any files

  # Settings
 For Settins open yuzu up Emulation -> Configure -> Graphics, Select OpenGL and set it to Vulkan.
 Then go to Controls and Press Single Player yadiyadiyada and set it to this
 ![Reeeeeeee](https://nuke.bayern/tQRi6Dco.png?key=TKvixrA2KWor0u)

 Then Press Configure and Set Player 1 to Pro Controller if you have a Controller/Keyboard and to Joycons if Joycons.
 Press Configure and press the excat Buttons on your Controller (its easier for Xbox but for you PS4 and Keyboard Users i have a graphic for yo found [here](https://compass-ssl.xboxlive.com/assets/c7/a1/c7a12fbe-af04-4a90-92f2-18338219c2aa.png?n=one-controller-front-l.png))
 After your done press Okay and continue to the Next Step.

  # Games
 Download any ROM you want from any ROM Website you like.
 I recommend [Switch-XCI](https://switch-xci.com/), but any ROM Site does it.
 After you got your File (can be .ncp, .xci and .nsp) make a Folder somewhere on your PC and in that folder make a folder for your Game.
 After that Double-Click into Yuzu and select the Folder you put your Game Folder in.

Now the Game should be in the List. Next is do what i do

 # Aditional

  # GameUpdates

 Download the Update of your Game or DLCÂ´s as again .ncp, .xci ir .nps.
 Put it in your Folder of the Game, then open Yuzu. Do excatly as in there
 ![rererere](https://i.uwu.plus/hNmEGB8V.gif?key=gGAX37XVMM7o1q)
 For me it was already installed but it should then Show under Addons that you have it Installed

  # GetKeys

 To get Keys easily just go to [this Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/YuzuPiracy/) and look for posts with prod.keys
 Then just paste their code into a [decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) and then paste the outcome into prod.keys

  # Addons

 Here ima show how to install Mods.
 Its pretty simple, were gonna take the mod from [here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-dx-60-fps-mod.559469/)
 When you download the Zip File you will have a foler called ,,exefs_patches,,.
 Go inside that folder and in the other folder in there until you are at this file
 ![memememem](https://nuke.bayern/QTwbBtLy.png?key=GP1JZ3BylhCn9q)
 Then move that IPS file into exefs_patches and delete the now empty folder.
 Then rename exefs_patches into exefs.
 Now open Yuzu and rightclick your Game -> Open Mod Directory.
 Create a new folder with any Name you want and move the exefs folder into that, then restart Yuzu and your done.
 You now see your Mod at Compatability.
 - Additional Note here:
 If you got any other names for the folder rename the folder not to exefs.
 Instead rename them to romfs or romfs_ext.

 You can completly skip these steps if you use mods from [here](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/wiki/Switch-Mods)
