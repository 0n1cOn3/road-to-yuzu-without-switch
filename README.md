 # Introduction
 Hey, im Akira and im writing you a Guide on how to install Yuzu without having a Switch, since i discovered this is literally a pain in the ass.
 I try to make it as easy as possible, but be sure to check this out if you need new Keys, since i try to keep this always up-to-date! <3

 # Guide

 # Setup
 First you will need the [Yuzu-Installer](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/liftinstall/releases/download/1.8/yuzu_install.exe).
 Open it, and let it do its own stuff and be sure to have it like this.

 Create a folder called "keys" and copy the key you got from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i17XAjiwKLwml_9mzLQ4GF6RYidaCFcG?usp=sharing) Section and paste it in the Foler.
 Then go back out of the keys Folder and paste the Contents of the Switch Fimware Folder found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SwobY3yIATNeFc-HC3z_iJKhkG-9pLR6?usp=sharing) and click yes if it wants to override any files
