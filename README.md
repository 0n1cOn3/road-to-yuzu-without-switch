 # Introduction
 Hey, im Akira and im writing you a Guide on how to install Yuzu without having a Switch, since i discovered this is literally a pain in the ass.
 I try to make it as easy as possible, but be sure to check this out if you need new Keys, since i try to keep this always up-to-date! <3

 Open it, and let it do its own stuff and be sure to have it like this.
